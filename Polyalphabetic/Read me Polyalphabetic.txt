Polyalphabetic Ciphers

In this project we have just created one .cpp file(PolyalphabeticCipher.cpp) with a main function and 3 functions M1, M2 and M3 for different encryption technique according to the requirement specification. These methods are called in cyclic order M2,M3,M2,M1,M3.

In this project we are reading the plaintext line by line, and storing each character into a vector(text).

A vector(method) of the size of the vector(text) is created which stores M1, M2 and M3 in cyclic order.

Now considering vector(method) each character in vector(text) is encrypted and stored into the file.

How to run the programe in ranger
1. make
2. ./proj2
3. For Encryption press 1, For Decryption press 2.
4. if you enter 1, the program will read file plaintxt.text (input) and store the encrypted data in ciphertext.txt (output).
5. if you enter 2, the program will read file ciphertext.txt (input) and store the decrypted data in decrypttext.txt (output).
6. If input file is not present the program will be aborted
7. If the input file contains spaces or special characters the program will store it as it is.
8. The program reads new line as well
