Railfence Ciphers

In this project we have just created 3 file (RailFenceCipher.cpp, EncryptDecrypt.cpp, EncryptDecrypt.h) 

In this project we are reading the plaintext line by line, and storing each character into a vector(text).

This vector is than sent as parameter to encryption function for encryption and decryption function for decryption


How to run the programe in ranger
1. make
2. ./Rail
3. For Encryption press 1, For Decryption press 2.
4. if you enter 1, the program will read file plaintxt.text (input) and store the encrypted data in ciphertext.txt (output).
5. if you enter 2, the program will read file ciphertext.txt (input) and store the decrypted data in decrypttext.txt (output).
6. If input file is not present the program will be aborted
7. If the input file contains spaces or special characters the program will store it as it is. File should not have *.
8. The program reads new line as well
9. The program prompts the user to enter depth 
10. The message is then encrypted/decrypted respectively
